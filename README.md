# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview
This project implements a basic **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious or malicious activities using rule-based detection.

The goal of this project is to understand how real-world IDS tools analyze packets, generate alerts, and help defenders identify attacks.

---

## Objectives
- Understand network-based attacks
- Learn how IDS tools detect anomalies
- Write and test basic detection rules
- Analyze logs and alerts like a SOC analyst

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Snort (IDS engine)
- Wireshark (packet analysis)
- Linux environment
- Basic networking concepts (TCP/IP)

---

## Attacks Detected
- SYN Flood Attack
- Port Scanning
- ICMP Flood (planned)
